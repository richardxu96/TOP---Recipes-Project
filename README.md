# TOP---Recipes-Project
Project to learn using HTML including text, links, and images

Before getting into the project, the first part of the project is to remember how to use GitHub and create a new repo
- remember to make atomic commits throughout the project

Project
- Create index page that has relative links to 3 different recipes
- Each recipe should have a header with a name, image, and description
- Unorganized list for ingredients, organized list for steps
- Absolute link to allrecipes.com page

Bonus 1
- After learning about CSS, coming back and incorporating that to Recipes
- Only learned about changing Font size, color, background color, and weights plus text align and image resizing
    - Images = Center and make larger while keeping same proportions
    - Titles = Center, Bold, Change Font, and Change Colors
        - Colors = Greenbean is green, Sweetpotato is orange, and Stuffing is brown
    - Add some comments in Index
